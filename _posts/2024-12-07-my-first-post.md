Hi, this is the first post of the blog. I'm a Wixoss Selector from Indonesia, and I'm planning to post deck tech and also about current meta of Wixoss that I find, at least in my local areas. You can mostly find me in GoodGuyGames shop but I occassionaly play on HBST HQ and ChekkuPointo as well in Indonesia. I hope I can be consistent in creating contents about Wixoss, probably on a weekly basis but don't expect much. I might also post some tournament reports on my locals, so that's another sort of content.

Oh, I play Piruluk Denki as my main deck, but I do occassionally play other decks like Hanayo Houseki, Azaela, Remember Cosmos, Ruuko, and some other random decks I found to be interesting enough.

I guess that's all for now, see you next time.
